# Salvo, A Lightweight PHP MVC Framework #

This project is longer longer being maintained.  I will keep the project for reference proposes only.

If you are looking for a good framework that it somewhere between Silex and Symfony 2 (which is what this framework was inteneded to be), I would suggest https://github.com/laravel/framework.
